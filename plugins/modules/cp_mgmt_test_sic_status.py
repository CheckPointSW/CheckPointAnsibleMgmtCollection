module: cp_mgmt_test_sic_status
short_description: Test SIC Status reflects the state of the gateway after it has received the certificate issued by the
                   ICA. If the SIC status is Unknown then there is no connection between the gateway and the Security
                   Management Server. If the SIC status is No Communication, an error message will appear. It may
                   contain specific instructions on how to fix the situation.
